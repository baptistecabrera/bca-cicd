# Bca CI/CD

## Description

This repository is used to centralize common CI/CD tools (YAML pipelines templates, Chocolatey artifacts, PR templates, ...) for all my projects.

You can also find build and release pipelines that can be used out-of the box:
- for PowerShell scripts or modules under [`azuredevops/pipelines/samples/powershell`](azuredevops/pipelines/samples/powershell/ReadMe.md)

## Disclaimer
These tools have been created to answer my needs, but I provide them as-is to people who may need such tools.
Feel free to copy and modify them according to your needs, but contributions are more than welcome.
